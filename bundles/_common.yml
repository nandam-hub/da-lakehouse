# Shared Configuration for All Raw Layer Databricks Asset Bundles
# ==============================================================================
# This file contains common variables that are reused across all bundles
# in this repository (drs, guidewire_cda, etc.)
#
# Note: YAML anchors (&anchor_name) cannot be shared across files, so each
# bundle must define its own anchors for permissions and config blocks.
